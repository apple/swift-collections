  // FIXME: Implement `partition(by:)` by making storage contiguous,
  // and partitioning that.

  /// Call `body(b)`, where `b` is an unsafe buffer pointer to the deque's
  /// mutable contiguous storage. If the deque's contents aren't stored
  /// contiguously, `body` is not called and `nil` is returned. The supplied
  /// buffer pointer is only valid for the duration of the call.
  ///
  /// Often, the optimizer can eliminate bounds- and uniqueness-checks within an
  /// algorithm, but when that fails, invoking the same algorithm on the unsafe
  /// buffer supplied to `body` lets you trade safety for speed.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - body: The function to invoke.
  ///
  /// - Returns: The value returned by `body`, or `nil` if `body` wasn't called.

  ///    underlying storage; O(`count`) otherwise. (Not counting the call to
  ///    `body`.)
