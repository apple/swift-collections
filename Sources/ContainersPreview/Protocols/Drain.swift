/// without requiring them to be moved into any temporary buffer.
///
/// Drains are inherently also producers -- they can produce items by simply
/// moving their consumable contents to the client-supplied series of
/// output spans.

  // TODO: The primary use case does not need this to throw; do we need to allow that?
  // Note: making this failable is not entirely straightforward, as there is no
  // easy way to signal partial success -- conforming implementations
  // would likely need to store errors they encounter midway through a
  // chunk and report them at the beginning of the next iteration.
  // I take this as an indication that we don't need to do that.
  // (Contrast with this `Producer.generate(into:)`; the shape of that method
  // allows it to partially populate its client-supplied target and still
  // report an error.)
  //
  // Note: We can also express this with a higher-order shape:
  //
  //     mutating func drainNext<E: Error, R: ~Copyable>(
  //       _ body: (inout InputSpan<Element>) throws(E) -> R
  //     ) throws(E) -> R
  //
  // This would allow partial consumption, eliminating the need for
  // `maximumCount`, but at the cost of having to deal with closures --
  // it can be tricky to elegantly flow data/control in & out higher-order
  // functions. Allowing the function argument to throw also precludes
  // the drain itself from throwing, unless they are both required
  // to use the same error type, which would be impractical.

  /// generated, and do not necessarilly need to be discarded.)
  ///
  /// This protocol does not specify the meaning of a failure, or the
  /// precise state of the iterator after an error is thrown; however, the
  /// error must not trigger runtime traps in subsequent attempts at iteration.
  /// (After a failure, conforming types may choose to produce new items, or
  /// signal the end of the iteration, or throw another error, which may or may
  /// not match the first.)
  ///
  /// Absent of more specific information, generic code should stop
  /// iterating, discard the producer and rethrow the error when it encounters
  /// a failure. Generic code is encouraged to preserve the items that got
  /// successfully produced before the throw (including ones appended by
  /// the call that ultimately ended in failure); however, whether this is
  /// possible (or desirable) ultimately depends on the specific problem that
  /// the algorithm is solving.
  ///
  /// - Parameter target: An output span ready to take newly generated items.
  /// - Returns: A boolean value indicating whether the operation was able to
  ///    append at least one item to the supplied output span without hitting
  ///    the end of the underlying sequence.
