/// A type that supplies the values of a generative sequence by populating
/// a client-supplied series of `OutputSpan` instances. "Generative" sequences
/// transfer the ownership of items they produce to their clients, rather than
/// merely providing borrowing access to them. A `Producer` instance represents
/// an ongoing iteration over such a generative sequence.

  /// always succeeds.

  /// A value less than or equal to the number of remaining items that this
  /// producer is able to generate until it reaches its end.

  /// Generate the next batch of items into the supplied output span instance,
  /// which must have room for at least one new element.
  ///
  /// Repeatedly calling this method produces, in order, all the elements of the
  /// underlying generative sequence. As soon as the sequence has run out of
  /// elements, all subsequent calls return false without appending any new
  /// items to their target. This method is not guaranteed to fully populate the
  /// given output span, but it always appends at least one item until the end
  /// of the underlying generative sequence.
  ///
  /// The ownership of all generated elements is transferred to the caller of
  /// this method -- it can arbitrarily store, mutate, consume or discard them
  /// as needed, even across invocations of this method, or after the producer
  /// is destroyed.
  ///
  /// The returned Boolean value can be used to easily determine if the
  /// method was able to make progress towards filling `target` without hitting
  /// the end of the underlying sequence.
  ///
  /// If `target` is a full span, this method is allowed to unconditionally
  /// return true. Passing an empty span is not a reliable way to test if the
  /// producer has reached its end. (Some producers may only be able to detect
  /// that they are finished while trying to generate the next item.)
  ///
  /// ### Error handling
  ///
  /// This method throws an error to indicate a failure while trying to generate
  /// the upcoming next item in the sequence. Failure may happen midway through
  /// populating `target`, in which case the output span will still gain
  /// new items despite the error. (Those items are successfully
  /// generated, and do not necessarilly need to be discarded.)
  ///
  /// This protocol does not specify the meaning of a failure, or the
  /// precise state of the iterator after an error is thrown; however, the
  /// error must not trigger runtime traps in subsequent attempts at iteration.
  /// (After a failure, conforming types may choose to produce new items, or
  /// signal the end of the iteration, or throw another error, which may or may
  /// not match the first.)
  ///
  /// Absent of more specific information, generic code should stop
  /// iterating, discard the producer and rethrow the error when it encounters
  /// a failure. Generic code is encouraged to preserve the items that got
  /// successfully produced before the throw (including ones appended by
  /// the call that ultimately ended in failure); however, whether this is
  /// possible (or desirable) ultimately depends on the specific problem that
  /// the algorithm is solving.
  ///
  /// - Parameter target: An output span ready to take newly generated items.
  /// - Returns: A boolean value indicating whether the operation was able to
  ///    append at least one item to the supplied output span without hitting
  ///    the end of the underlying sequence.
