/// An ordered collection of unique elements.
///
/// Similar to the standard `Set`, ordered sets ensure that each element appears
/// only once in the collection, and they provide efficient tests for
/// membership. However, like `Array` (and unlike `Set`), ordered sets maintain
/// their elements in a particular user-specified order, and they support
/// efficient random-access traversal of their members.
///
/// `OrderedSet` is a useful alternative to `Set` when the order of elements is
/// important, or when you need to be able to efficiently access elements at
/// various positions within the collection. It can also be used instead of an
/// `Array` when each element needs to be unique, or when you need to be able to
/// quickly determine if a value is a member of the collection.
///
/// You can create an ordered set with any element type that conforms to the
/// `Hashable` protocol.
///
///     let buildingMaterials: OrderedSet = ["straw", "sticks", "bricks"]
///
///
/// # Equality of Ordered Sets
///
/// Two ordered sets are considered equal if they contain the same elements, and
/// *in the same order*. This matches the concept of equality of an `Array`, and
/// it is different from the unordered `Set`.
///
///     let a: OrderedSet = [1, 2, 3, 4]
///     let b: OrderedSet = [4, 3, 2, 1]
///     a == b // false
///     b.sort() // `b` now has value [1, 2, 3, 4]
///     a == b // true
///
/// # Set Operations
///
/// `OrderedSet` implements most, but not all, `SetAlgebra` requirements. In
/// particular, it supports the membership test ``contains(_:)`` as well as all
/// high-level set operations such as ``union(_:)-67y2h``,
/// ``intersection(_:)-4o09a`` or ``isSubset(of:)-ptij``.
///
///     buildingMaterials.contains("glass") // false
///     buildingMaterials.intersection(["bricks", "straw"]) // ["straw", "bricks"]
///
/// Operations that return an ordered set usually preserve the ordering of
/// elements in their input. For example, in the case of the `intersection` call
/// above, the ordering of elements in the result is guaranteed to match their
/// order in the first input set, `buildingMaterials`.
///
/// On the other hand, predicates such as ``isSubset(of:)-ptij`` tend to ignore
/// element ordering:
///
///     let moreMaterials: OrderedSet = ["bricks", "glass", "sticks", "straw"]
///     buildingMaterials.isSubset(of: moreMaterials) // true
///
/// `OrderedSet` does not implement `insert(_:)` nor `update(with:)` from
/// `SetAlgebra` -- it provides its own variants for insertion that are more
/// explicit about where in the collection new elements gets inserted:
///
///     func append(_ item: Element) -> (inserted: Bool, index: Int)
///     func insert(_ item: Element, at index: Int) -> (inserted: Bool, index: Int)
///     func updateOrAppend(_ item: Element) -> Element?
///     func updateOrInsert(_ item: Element, at index: Int) -> (originalMember: Element?, index: Int)
///     func update(_ item: Element, at index: Int) -> Element
///
/// Additionally,`OrderedSet` has an order-sensitive definition of equality (see
/// above) that is incompatible with `SetAlgebra`'s documented semantic
/// requirements. Accordingly, `OrderedSet` does not (cannot) itself conform to
/// `SetAlgebra`.
///
/// # Unordered Set View
///
/// For cases where `SetAlgebra` conformance is desired (such as when passing an
/// ordered set to a function that is generic over that protocol), `OrderedSet`
/// provides an efficient *unordered view* of its elements that conforms to
/// `SetAlgebra`. This view is accessed through the ``unordered`` property, and
/// it implements the same concept of equality as the standard `Set`, ignoring
/// element ordering.
///
///     var a: OrderedSet = [0, 1, 2, 3]
///     let b: OrderedSet = [3, 2, 1, 0]
///     a == b // false
///     a.unordered == b.unordered // true
///
///     func frobnicate<S: SetAlgebra>(_ set: S) { ... }
///     frobnicate(a) // error: `OrderedSet<String>` does not conform to `SetAlgebra`
///     frobnicate(a.unordered) // OK
///
/// The unordered view is mutable. Insertions into it implicitly append new
/// elements to the end of the collection.
///
///     buildingMaterials.unordered.insert("glass") // => inserted: true
///     // buildingMaterials is now ["straw", "sticks", "bricks", "glass"]
///
/// Accessing the unordered view is an efficient operation, with constant
/// (minimal) overhead. Direct mutations of the unordered view (such as the
/// insertion above) are executed in place when possible. However, as usual with
/// copy-on-write collections, if you make a copy of the view (such as by
/// extracting its value into a named variable), the resulting values will share
/// the same underlying storage, so mutations of either will incur a copy of the
/// whole set.
///
/// # Sequence and Collection Operations
///
/// Ordered sets are random-access collections. Members are assigned integer
/// indices, with the first element always being at index `0`:
///
///     let buildingMaterials: OrderedSet = ["straw", "sticks", "bricks"]
///     buildingMaterials[1] // "sticks"
///     buildingMaterials.firstIndex(of: "bricks") // 2
///
///     for i in 0 ..< buildingMaterials.count {
///       print("Little piggie #\(i) built a house of \(buildingMaterials[i])")
///     }
///     // Little piggie #0 built a house of straw
///     // Little piggie #1 built a house of sticks
///     // Little piggie #2 built a house of bricks
///
/// Because `OrderedSet` needs to keep its members unique, it cannot conform to
/// the full `MutableCollection` or `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocols.
/// Operations such as `MutableCollection`'s subscript setter or
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection`'s `replaceSubrange` method assume the ability
/// to insert/replace arbitrary elements in the collection, but allowing that
/// could lead to duplicate values.
///
/// However, `OrderedSet` is able to partially implement these two protocols;
/// namely, it supports mutation operations that merely change the
/// order of elements (such as ``sort()`` or ``swapAt(_:_:)``, or just remove
/// some subset of existing members (such as ``remove(at:)`` or
/// ``removeAll(where:)``).
///
/// Accordingly, `OrderedSet` provides permutation operations from `MutableCollection`:
/// - ``swapAt(_:_:)``
/// - ``partition(by:)``
/// - ``sort()``, ``sort(by:)``
/// - ``shuffle()``, ``shuffle(using:)``
/// - ``reverse()``
///
/// It also supports removal operations from `RangeReplaceableCollection`:
/// - ``removeAll(keepingCapacity:)``
/// - ``remove(at:)``
/// - ``removeSubrange(_:)-2fqke``, ``removeSubrange(_:)-62u6a``
/// - ``removeLast()``, ``removeLast(_:)``
/// - ``removeFirst()``, ``removeFirst(_:)``
/// - ``removeAll(where:)``
///
/// `OrderedSet` also implements ``reserveCapacity(_:)`` from
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection`, to allow for efficient insertion of a known
/// number of elements. (However, unlike `Array` and `Set`, `OrderedSet` does
/// not provide a `capacity` property.)
///
/// # Accessing The Contents of an Ordered Set as an Array
///
/// In cases where you need to pass the contents of an ordered set to a function
/// that only takes an array value or (or something that's generic over
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection` or `MutableCollection`), then the best option
/// is usually to directly extract the members of the `OrderedSet` as an `Array`
/// value using its ``elements`` property. `OrderedSet` uses a standard array
/// value for element storage, so extracting the array value has minimal
/// overhead.
///
///     func pickyFunction(_ items: Array<Int>)
///
///     var set: OrderedSet = [0, 1, 2, 3]
///     pickyFunction(set) // error
///     pickyFunction(set.elements) // OK
///
/// It is also possible to mutate the set by updating the value of the
/// ``elements`` property. This guarantees that direct mutations happen in place
/// when possible (i.e., without spurious copy-on-write copies).
///
/// However, the set needs to ensure the uniqueness of its members, so every
/// update to ``elements`` includes a postprocessing step to detect and remove
/// duplicates over the entire array. This can be slower than doing the
/// equivalent updates with direct `OrderedSet` operations, so updating
/// ``elements`` is best used in cases where direct implementations aren't
/// available -- for example, when you need to call a `MutableCollection`
/// algorithm that isn't directly implemented by `OrderedSet` itself.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// An `OrderedSet` stores its members in a standard `Array` value (exposed by
/// the ``elements`` property). It also maintains a separate hash table
/// containing array indices into this array; this hash table is used to ensure
/// member uniqueness and to implement fast membership tests.
///
/// ## Element Lookups
///
/// Like the standard `Set`, looking up a member is expected to execute
/// a constant number of hashing and equality check operations. To look up
/// an element, `OrderedSet` generates a hash value from it, and then finds a
/// set of array indices within the hash table that could potentially contain
/// the element we're looking for. By looking through these indices in the
/// storage array, `OrderedSet` is able to determine if the element is a member.
/// As long as `Element` properly implements hashing, the size of this set of
/// candidate indices is expected to have a constant upper bound, so looking up
/// an item will be a constant operation.
///
/// ## Appending New Items
///
/// Similarly, appending a new element to the end of an `OrderedSet` is expected
/// to require amortized O(1) hashing/comparison/copy operations on the
/// element type, just like inserting an item into a standard `Set`.
/// (If the ordered set value has multiple copies, then appending an item will
/// need to copy all its items into unique storage (again just like the standard
/// `Set`) -- but once the set has been uniqued, additional appends will only
/// perform a constant number of operations, so when averaged over many appends,
/// the overall complexity comes out as O(1).)
///
/// ## Removing Items and Inserting in Places Other Than the End
///
/// Unfortunately, `OrderedSet` does not emulate `Set`'s performance for all
/// operations. In particular, operations that insert or remove elements at the
/// front or in the middle of an ordered set are generally expected to be
/// significantly slower than with `Set`. To perform these operations, an
/// `OrderedSet` needs to perform the corresponding operation in the storage
/// array, and then it needs to renumber all subsequent members in the hash
/// table. Both of these phases take a number of steps that grows linearly with
/// the size of the ordered set, while the standard `Set` can do the
/// corresponding operations with O(1) expected complexity.
///
/// This generally makes `OrderedSet` a poor replacement to `Set` in use cases
/// that do not specifically require a particular element ordering.
///
/// ## Memory Utilization
///
/// The hash table in an ordered set never needs to store larger indices than
/// the current size of the storage array, and `OrderedSet` makes use of this
/// observation to reduce the number of bits it uses to encode these integer
/// values. Additionally, the actual hashed elements are stored in a flat array
/// value rather than the hash table itself, so they aren't subject to the hash
/// table's strict maximum load factor. These two observations combine to
/// optimize the memory utilization of `OrderedSet`, sometimes making it even
/// more efficient than the standard `Set` -- despite the additional
/// functionality of preserving element ordering.
///
/// ## Proper Hashing is Crucial
///
/// Similar to the standard `Set` type, the performance of hashing operations in
/// `OrderedSet` is highly sensitive to the quality of hashing implemented by
/// the `Element` type. Failing to correctly implement hashing can easily lead
/// to unacceptable performance, with the severity of the effect increasing with
/// the size of the hash table.
///
/// In particular, if a certain set of elements all produce the same hash value,
/// then hash table lookups regress to searching an element in an unsorted
/// array, i.e., a linear operation. To ensure hashed collection types exhibit
/// their target performance, it is important to ensure that such collisions
/// cannot be induced merely by adding a particular list of members to the set.
///
/// The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure `Element` implements hashing
/// following `Hashable`'s documented best practices. The `Element` type must
/// implement the `hash(into:)` requirement (not `hashValue`) in such a way that
/// every bit of information that is compared in `==` is fed into the supplied
/// `Hasher` value. When used correctly, `Hasher` produces high-quality,
/// randomly seeded hash values that prevent repeatable hash collisions and
/// therefore avoid (intentional or accidental) denial of service attacks.
///
/// Like with all hashed collection types, all complexity guarantees are null
/// and void if `Element` implements `Hashable` incorrectly. In the worst case,
/// the hash table can regress into a particularly slow implementation of an
/// unsorted array, with even basic lookup operations taking complexity
/// proportional to the size of the set.
