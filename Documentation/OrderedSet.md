# OrderedSet

An ordered collection of unique elements.

## Declaration

```swift
import OrderedCollections

@frozen struct OrderedSet<Element: Hashable>
```

## Overview

Similar to the standard `Set`, ordered sets ensure that each element appears
only once in the collection, and they provide efficient tests for
membership. However, like `Array` (and unlike `Set`), ordered sets maintain
their elements in a particular user-specified order, and they support
efficient random-access traversal of their members.

`OrderedSet` is a useful alternative to `Set` when the order of elements is
important, or when you need to be able to efficiently access elements at
various positions within the collection. It can also be used instead of an
`Array` when each element needs to be unique, or when you need to be able to
quickly determine if a value is a member of the collection.

You can create an ordered set with any element type that conforms to the
`Hashable` protocol.

```swift
let buildingMaterials: OrderedSet = ["straw", "sticks", "bricks"]
```


### Equality of Ordered Sets

Two ordered sets are considered equal if they contain the same elements, and
*in the same order*. This matches the concept of equality of an `Array`, and
it is different from the unordered `Set`.

```swift
let a: OrderedSet = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let b: OrderedSet = [4, 3, 2, 1]
a == b // false
b.sort() // `b` now has value [1, 2, 3, 4]
a == b // true
```

### Set Operations

`OrderedSet` implements most, but not all, `SetAlgebra` requirements. In
particular, it supports the membership test `contains(_:)` as well as all
high-level set operations such as `union(_:)`, `intersection(_:)` or
`isSubset(of:)`.

```swift
buildingMaterials.contains("glass") // false
buildingMaterials.intersection(["brick", "straw"]) // ["straw", "brick"]
```

Operations that return an ordered set usually preserve the ordering of
elements in their input. For example, in the case of the `intersection` call
above, the ordering of elements in the result is guaranteed to match their
order in the first input set, `buildingMaterials`.

On the other hand, predicates such as `isSubset(of:)` tend to ignore element
ordering:

```swift
let moreMaterials: OrderedSet = ["bricks", "glass", "sticks", "straw"]
buildingMaterials.isSubset(of: moreMaterials) // true
```

However, `OrderedSet` does not implement `insert(_:)` nor `update(with:)` --
it provides its own variants for insertion that are more explicit about
where in the collection new elements gets inserted:

```swift
func insert(_ item: Element, at index: Index) -> (inserted: Bool, index: Int)
func append(_ item: Element) -> (inserted: Bool, index: Int)
func update(at index: Int, with item: Element) -> Element
func updateOrAppend(_ item: Element) -> Element?
```

Additionally,`OrderedSet` has an order-sensitive definition of equality (see
above) that is incompatible with `SetAlgebra`'s documented semantic
requirements. Accordingly, `OrderedSet` does not (cannot) itself conform to
`SetAlgebra`.

### Unordered Set View

For cases where `SetAlgebra` conformance is desired (such as when passing an
ordered set to a function that is generic over that protocol), `OrderedSet`
provides an efficient *unordered view* of its elements that conforms to
`SetAlgebra`. The unordered view implements the same concept of equality as
the standard `Set`, ignoring element ordering.

```swift
var a: OrderedSet = [0, 1, 2, 3]
let b: OrderedSet = [3, 2, 1, 0]
a == b // false
a.unordered == b.unordered // true

func frobnicate<S: OrderedSet>(_ set: S) { ... }
frobnicate(a) // error: `OrderedSet<String>` does not conform to `SetAlgebra`
frobnicate(a.unordered) // OK
```

The unordered view is mutable. Insertions into it implicitly append new
elements to the end of the collection.

```swift
buildingMaterials.unordered.insert("glass") // => inserted: true
// buildingMaterials is now ["straw", "sticks", "brick", "glass"]
```

Accessing the unordered view is an efficient operation, with constant
(minimal) overhead. Direct mutations of the unordered view (such as the
insertion above) are executed in place when possible. However, as usual with
copy-on-write collections, if you make a copy of the view (such as by
extracting its value into a named variable), the resulting values will share
the same underlying storage, so mutations of either will incur a copy of the
whole set.

### Sequence and Collection Operations

Ordered sets are random-access collections. Members are assigned integer
indices, with the first element always being at index `0`:

```swift
let buildingMaterials: OrderedSet = ["straw", "sticks", "bricks"]
buildingMaterials[1] // "sticks"
buildingMaterials.firstIndex(of: "bricks") // 2

for i in 0 ..< buildingMaterials.count {
  print("Little piggie #\(i) built a house of \(buildingMaterials[i])")
}
// Little piggie #0 built a house of straw
// Little piggie #1 built a house of sticks
// Little piggie #2 built a house of bricks
```

Because `OrderedSet` needs to keep its members unique, it cannot conform to
the full `MutableCollection` or `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocols.
Operations such as `MutableCollection`'s subscript setter or
`RangeReplaceableCollection`'s `replaceSubrange` assume the ability to
insert/replace arbitrary elements in the collection, but allowing that could
lead to duplicate values.

However, `OrderedSet` is able to partially implement these two protocols;
namely, there is no issue with mutation operations that merely change the
order of elements, or just remove some subset of existing members:

```swift
// Permutation operations from MutableCollection:
func swapAt(_ i: Int, _ j: Int)
func partition(by predicate: (Element) throws -> Bool) -> rethrows Int
func sort() where Element: Comparable
func sort(by predicate: (Element, Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
func shuffle()
func shuffle<T: RandomNumberGenerator>(using generator: inout T)
func reverse()

// Removal operations from RangeReplaceableCollection:
func removeAll(keepingCapacity: Bool = false)
func remove(at index: Int) -> Element
func removeSubrange(_ bounds: Range<Int>)
func removeLast() -> Element
func removeLast(_ n: Int)
func removeFirst() -> Element
func removeFirst(_ n: Int)
func removeAll(where shouldBeRemoved: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
```

`OrderedSet` also implements `reserveCapacity(_)` from
`RangeReplaceableCollection`, to allow for efficient insertion of a known
number of elements. (However, unlike `Array` and `Set`, `OrderedSet` does
not provide a `capacity` property.)

### Accessing The Contents of an Ordered Set as an Array

In cases where you need to pass the contents of an ordered set to a function
that only takes an array value or (or something that's generic over
`RangeReplaceableCollection` or `MutableCollection`), then the best option
is usually to directly extract the members of the `OrderedSet` as an `Array`
value using its `elements` property. `OrderedSet` uses a standard array
value for element storage, so extracting the array value has minimal
overhead.

```swift
func pickyFunction(_ items: Array<Int>)

var set: OrderedSet = [0, 1, 2, 3]
pickyFunction(set) // error
pickyFunction(set.elements) // OK
```

It is also possible to mutate the set by updating the value of the
`elements` property. This guarantees that direct mutations happen in place
when possible (i.e., without spurious copy-on-write copies).

However, the set needs to ensure the uniqueness of its members, so every
update to `elements` includes a postprocessing step to detect and remove
duplicates over the entire array. This can be slower than doing the
equivalent updates with direct `OrderedSet` operations, so updating
`elements` is best used in cases where direct implementations aren't
available -- for example, when you need to call a `MutableCollection`
algorithm that isn't directly implemented by `OrderedSet` itself.

### Performance

Like the standard `Set` type, the performance of hashing operations in
`OrderedSet` is highly sensitive to the quality of hashing implemented by
the `Element` type. Failing to correctly implement hashing can easily lead
to unacceptable performance, with the severity of the effect increasing with
the size of the hash table.

In particular, if a certain set of elements all produce the same hash value,
then hash table lookups regress to searching an element in an unsorted
array, i.e., a linear operation. To ensure hashed collection types exhibit
their target performance, it is important to ensure that such collisions
cannot be induced merely by adding a particular list of members to the set.

The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure `Element` implements hashing
following `Hashable`'s documented best practices. The conformance must
implement the `hash(into:)` requirement, and every bit of information that
is combined into the supplied `Hasher` value must be compared in `==`.
When used correctly, `Hasher` produces high-quality, randomly seeded hash
values that prevent repeatable hash collisions.

When `Element` implements `Hashable` correctly, testing for membership in an
ordered set is expected to take O(1) equality checks on average. Hash
collisions can still occur organically, so the worst-case lookup performance
is technically still O(*n*) (where *n* is the size of the set); however,
long lookup chains are unlikely to occur in practice.

### Implementation Details

An `OrderedSet` stores its members in a regular `Array` value (exposed by
the `elements` property). It also maintains a standalone hash table
containing array indices alongside the array; this is used to implement fast
membership tests. The size of the array is limited by the capacity of the
corresponding hash table, so indices stored inside the hash table can be
encoded into fewer bits than a standard `Int` value, leading to a storage
representation that can often be more compact than that of `Set` itself.

Inserting or removing a single member (or a range of members) needs to
perform the corresponding operation in the storage array, in addition to
renumbering any subsequent members in the hash table. Therefore, these
operations are expected to have performance characteristics similar to an
`Array`: inserting or removing an element to the end of an ordered set is
expected to execute in O(1) operations, while they are expected to take
linear time at the front (or in the middle) of the set. (Note that this is
different to the standard `Set`, where insertions and removals are expected
to take amortized O(1) time.)
